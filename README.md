There are 13 exe programs and code files. All of them need to be in C:\C_Bernoulli

The programs provide coders or users the sufficient statistic, the point estimator, the test statistic, the goodness of fit, the confidence inteval, and one-way analysis of continuous bernoulli distribution. Of course, we can extend to continuous binomial distribution and continuous trinomial distribution.
