There are 13 exe programs and code files. All of them need to be in C:\C_Bernoulli

| Feature                       | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 1      | continuous bernoulli distribution | 
| 2      | continuous binomial distribution  | 
| 3      | continuous trinomial distribution |
| 4      | test statistic of continuous bernooulli distribution |

The programs provide coders or users the sufficient statistic, the point estimator, the test statistic, the goodness of fit, the confidence inteval, and one-way analysis of continuous bernoulli distribution. Of course, we can extend to continuous binomial distribution and continuous trinomial distribution.

For the mathematic derivation, you can read the pdf of free book on [Free-ebook.net](https://www.free-ebooks.net/computer-sciences-textbooks/Continuous-Bernoulli-distribution-simulator-and-test-statistic).
